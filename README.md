# Neural-Style-Transfer
A neural style transfer algorithm which uses a CNN trained with a style-cost function. 

The style-cost function makes use of two images, the style-image and the content-image to produce an image which is the content-image re-drawn in the style of the style-image, referred to as the generated image. 

The generated-image thus resembles an artwork similar to the original content-image but bearing the style of the style-image.
